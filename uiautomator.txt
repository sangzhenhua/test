1.<android-sdk>/tools/android create uitest-project -n <name> -t 1 -p <path>

The <name> is the name of the project that contains your uiautomator test source files, and the <path> is the path to the corresponding project directory. 

2.Go to the project directory where your build.xml file is located and build your test JAR.

ant build

3.Deploy your generated test JAR file to the test device by using the adb push command:

adb push <path_to_output_jar> /data/local/tmp/

Here¡¯s an example:

adb push ~/dev/workspace/LaunchSettings/bin/LaunchSettings.jar /data/local/tmp/

adb shell uiautomator runtest LaunchSettings.jar -c com.uia.example.my.LaunchSettings

adb push E:\workspace\UIAutoTest\bin\UIAutoTest.jar /data/local/tmp

adb shell uiautomator runtest UIAutoTest.jar -c com.pekall.test.mdmui.SettingUi
